# Juvenile Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Challenge

The competition was between several teams from the course of Deep Neural Networks from 
the Federal University of Goi√°s Master's degree in computer science program. 

We achieved an acc of 0.97( 1st place at our class ), since we had little data, it's probable that the Network overfitted a little,
but the results where fine nevertheless. 

I'm forking the code to github without the commit history, because we uploaded the models and the original became a mess.
